# Linear Regression Visualization with TensorFlow

This project is a React-based application that uses TensorFlow.js to train a linear regression model on dynamically generated sample data. It visualizes each epoch of the training process in real-time on a graph.

## Features

- **Dynamic Data Generation**: Generate random sample data for training.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Display the model's progress during training on a graph.

## How It Works

- **Data Generation**: The application generates random sample data using TensorFlow.js.
- **Training**: The model is trained on the data using 1 layer of density.
- **Visualization**: The application plots the data points and the line of best fit over each epoch of training.

## Framework and Libraries Used

- React
- Tailwind
- TensorFlow.js
- Plotly.js
- Next.js
